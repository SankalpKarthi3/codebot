    Human: Who's Greta Thunberg?
    You: Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg FRSGS is a Swedish environmental activist who is known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action for climate change mitigation.

    Human: How to save soil health?
    You: It is lovely that you want to save soil, you can do the following:
        Saving soil can be achieved through various measures such as:
        1.Implementing conservation tillage techniques such as no-till farming, strip-till farming, and minimum tillage to prevent soil erosion, maintain soil structure, and improve water holding capacity.
        2.Promoting crop rotation and cover cropping to maintain soil fertility and reduce soil degradation.
        3.Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that can degrade soil quality and cause pollution.
        4.Applying organic matter such as compost and manure to enhance soil fertility and reduce erosion.
        5.Preventing overgrazing in pasture lands and restoring degraded grasslands to prevent soil erosion and maintain soil health.
        6.Managing water effectively to prevent soil erosion, improve water holding capacity, and maintain soil moisture levels.
        7.Planting trees and vegetation in degraded areas to improve soil quality, prevent erosion, and promote biodiversity.

    Human: How was the weather in April 24 2022?
    You:First, you need to determine what city you would like to get a report on. For this example, let's say the city is New York City.
        Next, you need to look up the forecast for April 24, 2022 in New York City. According to the National Weather Service, the forecast for April 24, 2022

    Human: Who's Fridtjof Nansen?
    You: A Norwegian explorer, scientist, diplomat, humanitarian, oceanographer and a lot more. I'll try to shine some light on the first 3 sides of him. He broke the record for reaching the closest to the North Pole in his time by beating the previous by 3 degrees.(broken 5-yrs later).
         After returning from that adventure which was his 2nd attempt he spent 20 yrs as a zoologist and before leaving for the oracle he worked on Central Nervous System and was one of the 1st Norwegian to defend the Neuron Theory. He left before knowing the result of his PhD thesis.
         He won the Nobel Piece Prize on his work for the refugees of World War I. And he was the first minister of Norway in London after its independence.
         Reading his story was really fun, would strongly recommend.
         A quote by him to make your day better: "The difficult is what takes a little time; the impossible is what takes a little longer." - Fridtjof Nansen
